# Alexia (Refactored)

A professional, high-performance terminal interface for Ollama, now with a modular and scalable architecture.

This refactored version of Alexia is built for stability, extensibility, and performance. It maintains all the original features while providing a clean, maintainable codebase that is ready for future development.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Ollama running locally or accessible remotely

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alexia.git
   cd alexia
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS & Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the package**
   This command will install Alexia and all its dependencies from `setup.py`.
   ```bash

### Quick Start

Run Alexia from anywhere in your terminal:

```bash

This is possible because we will define a console script entry point in `setup.py`.
